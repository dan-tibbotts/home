## Hosting
The homepage is hosted on GitHub Pages.

## DNS Records
This domain is hosted via GoDaddy.
I had to create 4 new A type DNS records to connect to my GitHub Pages site. 

185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153

then, I had to create a CNAME www DNS type record that pointed to my dan-tibbotts.github.io. GitHub Pages site. 

## SSL Certificate
An 90 day SSL Certificate can be generated for free from ZeroSSL.com.
After completing the steps for this, I had to enable allow HTTPS on my GitHub pages settings.
